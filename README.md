# Machine Learning Models for Catalytic Selectivity Prediction

This repository contains the code and data used to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting catalytic selectivity based on ligand electronic and geometric descriptors.

The adsorption structures of small molecules on Pt and the calculated is and ts structures of neb and icohp have now been stored in the dft-s.zip file.
